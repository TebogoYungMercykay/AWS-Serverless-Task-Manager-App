# Getting Started

## Serverless

Your ability to delegate more of your operational duties to AWS and so increase your agility and innovation is made possible by serverless, which is the cloud's inherent architecture. You may create and execute apps and services using serverless technology without giving servers any thought. It does away with infrastructure management duties like capacity provisioning, operating system upkeep, server or cluster provisioning, and patching. Almost any backend service or application can be built with them, and everything needed to run and scale your application with high availability is taken care of for you.

## AWS Lambda

You can run code with AWS Lambda without setting up or managing servers. There is no fee when your code is not executing; you only pay for the compute time you use.

You may use Lambda to run code for almost any kind of application or backend service with no administration required. Simply upload your code, and Lambda will handle all the necessary steps to run and grow it with high availability.


## Amazon API Gateway

In order to construct, publish, maintain, monitor, and protect APIs at any size, developers can use the fully managed service known as Amazon API Gateway. It provides a complete framework for managing APIs. API Gateway manages traffic, permission and access control, monitoring, and API version management while enabling you to perform hundreds of thousands of API calls concurrently.

## Amazon DynamoDB

A consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale is required by all applications, and Amazon DynamoDB provides a quick and adaptable NoSQL database service that can meet this need.

For internet-scale applications, it is a fully managed, multiregion, multimaster, persistent database with built-in backup and restore, security, and in-memory caching.

## Amazon S3
